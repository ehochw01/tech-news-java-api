# Tech News - Java
    
## Description

Just Tech News is a website where users can post, upvote, and comment on links to news articles. In this project I used Java to refactor an existing application originally built using Node.js.

I also refactored the app using a Python backend. This can be viewed in my [python-newsfeed](https://github.com/ehochw01/python-newsfeed) repo.
